# Web-Programming-1-Class-Final-Project-
For my Web Programming 1 course final project, I created 3 pages related to a baseball team tryout. The first page being the introduction page, the second page being a form for the tryout that is unvalidated, and the third being the previous form but with javascript validation. All three pages link to one another.
